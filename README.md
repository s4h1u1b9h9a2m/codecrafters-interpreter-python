This is a starting point for Python solutions to the
["Build Your Own Build your own Interpreter" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview).

_Add a description of your course here_

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your `<fill_in_executable_name>` implementation is in
`app/main.py`. Study and uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to
pass the first stage:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

Time to move on to the next stage!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `python (3.12)` installed locally
1. Run `./<fill_in_script_name>.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

## Make sure you're using your id
```

```

## For windows, test in Docker
```
docker build -t http-server-python-test .
docker run -it --rm -p 4221:4221 http-server-python-test
```
